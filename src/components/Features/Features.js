            Apps are pieces of software that run on any device, such as laptop,
            smart phone, or an iPod or iPad. As devices increase in popularity -
            at home and business, as well as in the classroom - a seemingly
            endless range of apps have become available for purchase. Many of
            these apps are designed specifically for use by teachers and
            students.
